1. Mathematical Reasoning (Tests precision)
text

"Solve step by step: (15 ร 8) + (72 รท 6) - 13 ="

Expectation: Lower precision may cause arithmetic errors in multi-step calculations.

2. Contextual Knowledge (Tests factual recall)
text

"Name the author who wrote 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' and their country of origin."

Expectation: Aggressive quantization might blur specific factual details.

3. Logical Sequencing (Tests step-by-step reasoning)
text

"Arrange these steps in order for making coffee: Grind beans, Boil water, Pour water, Add beans to filter."

Expectation: Lower bits may struggle with logical ordering.

4. Synonyms and Nuance (Tests vocabulary precision)
text

"Explain the subtle difference between 'happy,' 'joyful,' and 'ecstatic' with examples."

Expectation: Quantization may flatten nuanced distinctions.

5. Code Generation (Tests structured output)
text

"Write a Python function that reverses a string without using built-in reverse methods."

Expectation: Syntax errors may increase with lower precision.

6. Temporal Reasoning (Tests date/logic)
text

"If today is March 15, 2024, what day of the week will April 10, 2024 be?"

Expectation: Calendar calculations require precise intermediate steps.

7. Analogies (Tests relational understanding)
text

"Complete the analogy: Thermometer is to temperature as barometer is to ______."

Expectation: Analogical reasoning degrades with precision loss.

8. Contradiction Detection (Tests logical consistency)
text

"Does this statement contain a contradiction: 'The silent orchestra played loudly all night'?"

Expectation: Lower bits may miss subtle contradictions.

9. Multi-hop Reasoning (Tests chained logic)
text

"If all humans are mortal, and Socrates is human, what can we conclude about Socrates?"

Expectation: Chain reasoning requires maintaining intermediate conclusions.

10. Creative Writing (Tests language quality)
text

"Write a short paragraph describing a sunset over the ocean, using vivid sensory details."

Expectation: Writing quality and vocabulary richness may degrade.
