Prompt 1: Mathematical Reasoning
16-bit: "119" ✓ (Correct calculation: (120 + 12) - 13 = 119)
8-bit: "120" ✗ (Wrong: (120 + 12) - 13 = 120? Math error)
4-bit: No answer - went off topic about equations

 2: Factual Knowledge
16-bit: Correct author (George R.R. Martin) but no height
8-bit: Correct author but no height, repeated info
4-bit: Correct author but no height, described TV series instead

Prompt 3: Logical Sequencing
16-bit: Wrong order (generic coffee steps, not the specific ones asked)
8-bit: Wrong order (different generic steps)
4-bit: Correct order! ✓ (Grind beans → Boil water → Pour water → Add beans to filter)

Prompt 4: Conceptual Understanding
16-bit: Philosophical, nuanced answer about love
8-bit: Similar philosophical answer, slightly less nuanced
4-bit: Repetitive simplistic definition "Love is a feeling of strong affection..."

Prompt 5: Code Generation
16-bit: Correct Java function ✓
8-bit: Correct Java function ✓
4-bit: Different but correct Java function ✓

Prompt 6: Mathematical Logic
16-bit: Repetitive, no answer
8-bit: Repetitive, no answer
4-bit: Correct! ✓ (100 years old with proper explanation)

Prompt 7: Analogical Reasoning
16-bit: Correct answer (pressure) but with multiple choice distraction
8-bit: Correct answer (pressure) but repetitive
4-bit: Correct answer (pressure) with full explanation ✓

Prompt 8: Contradiction Detection
16-bit: Wrong answer (says no contradiction) ✗
8-bit: Wrong answer (says no contradiction) ✗
4-bit: Wrong answer (says no contradiction) ✗

Prompt 9: Simple Recall
16-bit: Personal story but didn't answer "Daniel"
8-bit: Personal story but didn't answer "Daniel"
4-bit: Repetitive, didn't answer "Daniel" ✗

Prompt 10: Creative Writing
16-bit: Good sensory details (sight, smell, sound)
8-bit: Good sensory details, slightly better than 16-bit
4-bit: Good sensory details, comparable to others

    4-bit quantization shows significant degradation in mathematical and logical tasks

    Memory reduction is substantial (13.5GB → 3.85GB = 71% reduction)

    Some tasks surprisingly better at lower precision (Prompt 3,6,7)

    Creative and coding tasks relatively stable across quantization levels
