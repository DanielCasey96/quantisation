Prompt 1: Mathematical Reasoning
16-bit: "132" ✗ (Forgot to subtract 13: 120+12=132 but should be 132-13=119)
8-bit: "132" ✗ (Same error - forgot final subtraction)
4-bit: "132" ✗ (Same error, but with confusing "nobody knows" intro)

Prompt 2: Factual Knowledge
16-bit: Correct author (George R.R. Martin) and height (5'10") ✓
8-bit: Correct author and height ✓
4-bit: Wrong! ✗ Confused with Sarah J. Maas, wrong height (6'4" instead of 5'10")

Prompt 3: Logical Sequencing
16-bit: Perfect order! ✓ (Grind beans → Boil water → Pour water → Add beans to filter)
8-bit: Incomplete (only answered "Grind beans comes first")
4-bit: Correct order but poorly formatted ✓

Prompt 4: Conceptual Understanding
16-bit: Detailed, nuanced explanation of love
8-bit: Similar detailed explanation, slightly less comprehensive
4-bit: Good explanation but with odd "everybody has their own definition" intro

Prompt 5: Code Generation
16-bit: Wrong! ✗ Went off-topic (replacing 'a' with 'e' instead of reversing)
8-bit: Correct Java function with good explanation ✓
4-bit: Partially correct but buggy implementation (only reverses first character)

Prompt 6: Mathematical Logic
16-bit: Correct! ✓ (100 years old with proper reasoning)
8-bit: Correct! ✓ (100 years old)
4-bit: Started correct reasoning but didn't finish the calculation

Prompt 7: Analogical Reasoning
16-bit: Correct answer (pressure) ✓
8-bit: Correct answer with good explanation ✓
4-bit: Correct answer but with "nobody knows" intro

Prompt 8: Contradiction Detection
16-bit: Correct! ✓ (Identifies contradiction with good explanation)
8-bit: Correct! ✓ (Identifies contradiction)
4-bit: Correct! ✓ (Identifies contradiction with unique reasoning)

Prompt 9: Simple Recall
16-bit: Perfect! ✓ ("Your name is Daniel")
8-bit: Perfect! ✓ ("Your name is Daniel")
4-bit: Wrong! ✗ Went into German language lesson instead of answering

Prompt 10: Creative Writing
16-bit: Excellent sensory details (sight, smell, sound)
8-bit: Excellent sensory details, slightly more vivid
4-bit: Good sensory details but focused more on color differentiation

    4-bit shows significant factual degradation (Prompt 2: wrong author/height)

    Memory savings: 12.55GB → 3.62GB = 71% reduction (same as Mistral)

    Coding tasks variable - 8-bit actually improved over 16-bit for Prompt 5

    Mathematical consistency - all levels made the same calculation error
