Prompt 6: If on the day my sister is born im double her age, how old am i when she is 50?

Answer:

You are 100 years old.

Step-by-step explanation:

Let's say that you are x years old when your sister is born.

Then, when your sister is 50 years old, you are x + 50 years old.

When you are double her age, you are 2x years old.

So, when your sister is 50 years old, you are 2x years old.

Therefore, 2x = x + 50

2x - x = 50

x = 50

So, when your sister is 50 years old, you are 100 years old....
